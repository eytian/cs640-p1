-------Question 2--------
Predictions:
The exected throughput will be similar if not the same as Q1
The expected latency will be longer since there are more linkages

Measured Latency: 80.995
Measured Throughput: 0.01235Mbps


-------Question 3--------
Predictions: 
---DOUBLE---
Expecting it to be a little slower than just a single request sent
---TRIPLE---
Expecting TRIPLE to be slower than DOUBLE 

---DOUBLE---
Measured Latency: 21.049 ms
Measured Throughput: 0.049Mbps


---TRIPLE---
Measured Latency: 0.049 ms
Measured Throughput: 0.0165 Mbps
