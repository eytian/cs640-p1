-------Question 2--------
Predictions:
The exected throughput will be similar if not the same as Q1
The expected latency will be longer since there are more linkages

Measured Latency

-------Question 3--------
Predictions: 
---DOUBLE---
Expecting it to be a little slower than just a single request sent
---TRIPLE---
Expecting TRIPLE to be slower than DOUBLE 

---DOUBLE---
Measured Latency
