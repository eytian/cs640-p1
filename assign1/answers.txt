-------Question 2--------
Predictions:
The exected throughput will be similar if not the same as Q1
The expected latency will be longer since there are more links

Measured Latency: 80.995
Measured Throughput: 0.01235Mbps


-------Question 3--------
Predictions: 
---DOUBLE---
Expecting it to be a little slower than just a single request sent
---TRIPLE---
Expecting TRIPLE to be slower than DOUBLE 


---DOUBLE---
Measured Latency: 21.049 ms
Measured Throughput: 0.049Mbps

---TRIPLE---
Measured Latency: 0.049 ms
Measured Throughput: 0.0165 Mbps


-------Question 4--------
Predictions:
For both we think the results will be the same depending on number of switches

Measured Latency: 
h1-h4: 161.1
h5-h6: 41.5
Measured Throughput:
h1-h4: 125KB at 0.00625Mbps
h5-h6: 486KB at 0.0243Mbps 

Reasonings: 
We think there is a greater time directing the packets because having more than one host would create more congestion.
